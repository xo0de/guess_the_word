This is my first project after my first Python course. So don't expect anything extra from it.

This is a small guess the word game in which you need to guess what word the program has guessed. During the game you will have 6 attempts to guess the whole word, entering either the whole word or a separate letter.*

After each mistake, more and more parts of the man on the gallows will be displayed, after the whole man appears (6 letters or words entered incorrectly), you lose.

*YOU CANNOT ENTER MORE THAN 1 LETTER, THE PROGRAM WILL COUNT THIS AS AN ERROR AND WILL TAKE YOU ONE ATTEMPT.

Good game!
